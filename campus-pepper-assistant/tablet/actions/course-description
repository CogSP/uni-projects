TEXT
<*, *, it, *>: The course aims to introduce the student to the fundamental concepts of artificial vision and to the construction of autonomous systems of interpretation and reconstruction of a scene through images and video. The course deals with basic elements of projective and epipolar geometry, methods for 3D vision and vision based on multiple views, and methods for metric reconstruction and image and video interpretation methods

Instructor: Irene Amerini
