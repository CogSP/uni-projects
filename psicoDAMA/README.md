# PsicoDama

The aim of this work is to implement a fully functional checkers game with special psychedelic effects. The project was developed for the "Linguaggi e Tecnologie per il Web" (Sapienza - Ingegneria Informatica - 2023) exam.

# Technologies we used

We used HTML + CSS + Javascript with Bootstrap for the front-end, PHP for the back-end and PostgreSQL as our DBMS.


# How to install and run the project
Just clone the repo and run it locally ;)
